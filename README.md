Hi! 

My name is Albin Jonsson. I'm currently attending KTH and studying my second year in the "CivilingenjÃ¶r i Informationsteknik" program. This is my github where I have both personal projects, which you will find under the "Personal-projects" repository as well as my course work which you will find under  the KTH-courses repository. You will also be able to find a game that I was a part of the development team of at charmkvark.github.io

Thank you for visiting my github and hope you have a great day.
Best regards,
Albin Jonsson.
